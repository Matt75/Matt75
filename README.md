# Hi, I'm Matt üëã

I‚Äôm currently a **developer on the Payment Squad at [PrestaShop](https://prestashop.com)**, based in the beautiful Paris üá´üá∑ area, contributing to building innovative solutions for e-commerce merchants.

## Main project ü§ì

### [PrestaShop Checkout](https://prestashop.com/essentials/prestashop-checkout/)

The **official PrestaShop payment module** in partnership with [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/business/accept-payments), where I serve as the Main Developer.

Since 2019, I‚Äôve been working at PrestaShop on the Payment Squad, contributing to the PrestaShop Checkout product in collaboration with PayPal.

My work has focused on improving several key areas, including:
* [Advanced Credit and Debit Card Payments](https://www.paypal.com/us/business/accept-payments/checkout/integration#advanced-checkout): Migrated from the hosted-fields component to the modern card-fields component for better functionality and user experience.
* [PayPal Pay Later](https://www.paypal.com/us/business/accept-payments/checkout/installments): Implemented the installment payments
* Saved Payment Methods: Implemented the PayPal Vault v3 integration to securely store customer payment details for future use.
* Alternative Payment Methods: Enhanced integration by implementing the unbranded integration using the payment-fields component, providing merchants with more flexibility.
* Digital Wallets: Integrated Apple Pay and Google Pay, enabling seamless payment options for customers.
* Onboarding Experience: Upgraded the Partner Referrals API integration from v1 to v2, streamlining the onboarding process for sellers.

> Looking ahead, PrestaShop is committed to accelerating the evolution of PrestaShop Checkout by improving the PayPal integration to reduce troubleshooting and introducing new features in 2025. These enhancements aim to deliver even greater value to merchants and their customers.
