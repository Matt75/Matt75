# Hi, I'm Matt üëã

PrestaShop developer since 2012, based in the beautiful Paris üá´üá∑ area, with extensive hands-on experience in eCommerce development, including time at agencies like 202-ecommerce, where I specialized in integrating and optimizing solutions for merchants.

I began working with PayPal technologies in 2016, gaining deep expertise in payment integration and innovation.

In December 2018, I joined PrestaShop, initially contributing to the Marketplace team. Since 2019, I‚Äôve been part of the Payment Squad, leading the development of PrestaShop Checkout in collaboration with PayPal. My focus has been on creating cutting-edge payment solutions that empower merchants to succeed.

With over a decade of experience in the eCommerce ecosystem, I‚Äôm passionate about building tools that simplify and enhance online shopping experiences for businesses and their customers.

## Main project ü§ì

I‚Äôm currently a **developer on the Payment Squad** at [PrestaShop](https://prestashop.com), contributing to the [PrestaShop Checkout](https://prestashop.com/essentials/prestashop-checkout/) product, the **official PrestaShop payment module**, building innovative solutions in collaboration with [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/business/accept-payments).

My work has focused on improving several key areas, including:
* [Advanced Credit and Debit Card Payments](https://www.paypal.com/us/business/accept-payments/checkout/integration#advanced-checkout): Migrated from the hosted-fields component to the modern card-fields component for better functionality and user experience.
* [PayPal Pay Later](https://www.paypal.com/us/business/accept-payments/checkout/installments): Implemented the installment payments
* Saved Payment Methods: Implemented the PayPal Vault v3 integration to securely store customer payment details for future use.
* Alternative Payment Methods: Enhanced integration by implementing the unbranded integration using the payment-fields component, providing merchants with more flexibility.
* Digital Wallets: Integrated Apple Pay and Google Pay, enabling seamless payment options for customers.
* Onboarding Experience: Upgraded the Partner Referrals API integration from v1 to v2, streamlining the onboarding process for sellers.

> Looking ahead, PrestaShop is committed to accelerating the evolution of PrestaShop Checkout by improving the PayPal integration to reduce troubleshooting and introducing new features in 2025. These enhancements aim to deliver even greater value to merchants and their customers.
